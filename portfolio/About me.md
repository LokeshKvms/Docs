# About Me Section – Final Specification

## Purpose

- Introduce yourself with a short narrative.
- Explain your background, interests, and current direction.
- Replace a timeline with a clean, thoughtful overview of who you are.
- Maintain a formal, minimal, and professional tone consistent with the site.

## Layout

### On Normal / Desktop Screens

- **Two-column layout**:
  - **Left Column** (Visual block):
    - Contains the section heading: “About Me”
    - Background contains a subtle design — example: abstract shapes, SVG patterns, or icons related to frontend/web/dev
    - Styled using a shape (e.g., diagonal, curved, or geometric) to visually divide it from the right side
    - Not just a straight column split — more organic or asymmetric split for visual interest
  - **Right Column** (Content):
    - Contains 1–2 paragraphs introducing yourself:
      - Where you're from or studied
      - Your current internship and experience
      - What you like about frontend development
      - Your short-term goals (e.g., full-time role)
    - Text should stay within a comfortable reading width
    - Paragraphs styled for clarity and balance

### On Small Screens

- **Single-column stacked layout**:
  - “About Me” heading on top
  - Content follows below (stacked vertically)
  - Visual styling from the left column is either simplified or repositioned as a background accent
  - Padding and spacing adjusted for readability
  - Mobile-friendly font size and spacing

## Visual Design

- **Background of the left column**:
  - SVG pattern, abstract tech shapes, or simple dev-related icons (subtle, not distracting)
  - Theme-aware (adjusts based on dark/light mode)
  - Slight contrast or muted tones to maintain formality
- **Shape divider** between columns:
  - Could be a diagonal edge, curve, or a clipped polygon
  - Smooth transition between visual and text areas
- **Typography**:
  - Matches rest of site — clean sans-serif, consistent sizes
  - No overly decorative fonts

## Content Guidelines

- Avoid listing skills here (reserved for Skills section)
- Write in first person or neutral third person depending on tone
- Keep it brief — no more than 200–250 words
- End with a sentence that points toward your projects or interests

## Animation and Interaction (Optional)

- Fade-in animation on load for heading and paragraph content
- Subtle slide-in or reveal effect for the visual background (if dynamic)
- No hover effects needed for this section

## Accessibility and Responsiveness

- Text contrast and spacing maintained across themes
- Content readable and clear on all breakpoints
- Decorative background does not hinder readability
